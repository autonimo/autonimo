TASK
TASK SET (single set of tasks)
ROUTINE (set of task sets, can be run in parallel or sequentially)



- tasks and components are opened in the MDI.
- each have properties that can be set and functions that can run
-- tasks have task params, and validate/reset/run funcs
-- components have component params, component specific funcs
- can open multiple tasks and components (but not two copies of the same?)


- routine editor and ? are opened as single windows
- can only open one routine editor



TODO
- expose default location(s) for tasks, routines, etc, each can have more than one (add location)
-- could be on the network for instance

- move ui files to res folder, or make them from code only
- autovalidate when changing task params




GUIDE

For instance, to embed a function in a new task so that it is exposed to the desktop application,
make a new task that exposes the function's parameters and calls the function from the task's `run`
method.

{'a': ...},
{'b': ...},

def run(self):
    self.validate()
    some_func(a, b)
